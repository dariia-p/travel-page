Colour Scheme
When choosing the colour palette for the website, I was inspired by the city's existing logo. Also, focusing on the ancient side of the city, I chose colours that are associated with old artefacts that have darkened with time and yellowed pages of books.
#D4D1CA : used for the background of the pages and text in the navigation bar and cards on the visit page;
#47412D : used for the background of the navigation bar, and main text on the pages;
#9C4B1F : used for navigation links, external links, headers and pages decoration.

Banner Design
When creating the banners, I used two most memorable landmarks of the city - an old church and a railway station which perfectly matched the chosen colour scheme. I also used filters to make the photos less bright (like pictures on faded pages).

Navigation bar
The dark background was chosen for the navigation to contrast with the light banner and the background of the page body. Links were made orange (a darker colour for the current page) for a bright accent. The name and logo of the city are in the lightest colour so as not to shift the emphasis from the name and slogan on the banner.

The Home Page
The home page contains only basic information: a short description of the city, a map directly below it so that the user can immediately get acquainted with the location of the city, reasons to visit the city and tips for planning a trip (as well as links to the history and visit pages so that the user doesn’t need to scroll up to the navigation bar). There are no images on the page except for banners, so to make the page more colourful, there are dashed borders in the colour of the headers.

The History Page
The history page describes the position of the city in different epochs, including information on the construction of important historical monuments of the city and archaeological findings. The structure of the page was done using Flexbox. The page consists of containers, where text takes 75% of the space and 25% is taken by an image and its description. There was used the property “flex-wrap: wrap” to allow items to wrap into a new row and make the page look more spacious.

The Visit Page
The visit page uses Bootstrap and consists of two parts: 1. the trip plan with details on places to visit and 2. essential events for the best tourist experience. The first part was done with a 7:5 column ratio for large screens, 7 columns for text and 5 - for images, and full width (12 columns) for both on medium and small screens. The second part was done as cards consisting of images, headings, text and external links. For large screens, each card takes 50% of width (6 columns) and 100% (12 columns) for medium and small. The cards have a dark colour for the background and a light one for the text to contrast well with the first part of the page.
